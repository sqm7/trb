## Project Behavior

- **Environment**: macOS (Web Development)
- **Language**: Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) primarily.
- **Stack**: Vanilla HTML/JS/CSS, Supabase (Edge Functions, DB).

## 🚀 Deployment & Sync Rules (CRITICAL)

1.  **ALWAYS Check DEPLOYMENT.md**: Before identifying any task as "Deployment" or "Sync", read `DEPLOYMENT.md` first.
2.  **Local Authority**: Treat the local filesystem as the Source of Truth.
3.  **Explicit Approval**: NEVER sync to the remote `sqm7/kthd` repository without asking the user: "Ready to sync to Remote?" validation is required.
4.  **Documentation Sync**: When pushing code updates, ensuring `PLAN.md` and `SPEC.md` are also up-to-date and included in the push.

## Coding Standards

- **Style**: Keep it simple. Vanilla JS preferred over frameworks unless specified.
- **Naming**: camelCase for JS, kebab-case for CSS/files.
- **Comments**: Add comments for complex logic, especially for calculations in `analysis-engine.ts`.

## Documentation Rules

- **Update Trigger**: Update `SPEC.md` and `PLAN.md` BEFORE coding for major features, and AFTER coding for status updates.
