# Memory & Documentation

- **Strictly adhere to the [vibe-coding-protocol.md](file:///Users/ktpro/Desktop/vibe01/.cursor/rules/vibe-coding-protocol.md)** for all task lifecycles.
- Keep `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated as defined in the protocol.
- **IMPORTANT**: Whenever a new Agent Skill (in `.agent/skills/`) or Workflow (in `.agent/workflows/`) is added, updated, or removed, you **MUST** immediately update [AGENT_SKILLS_GUIDE.md](file:///Users/ktpro/Desktop/vibe01/AGENT_SKILLS_GUIDE.md) to reflect the changes.
